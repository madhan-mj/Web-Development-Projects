  summary: GNU Triangulated Surface Library
  description: |
    GTS stands for the GNU Triangulated Surface Library. It is an Open Source
    Free Software Library intended to provide a set of useful functions to
    deal with 3D surfaces meshed with interconnected triangles. The code is
    written entirely in C with an object-oriented approach based mostly on
    the design of GTK+. Careful attention is paid to performance related
    issues as the initial goal of GTS is to provide a simple and efficient
    library to scientists dealing with 3D computational surface meshes.
